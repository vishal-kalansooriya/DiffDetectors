## 📌 Project Overview

Players are presented with two images:
- A **correct image**
- A **modified image** with missing or altered details

The objective is to identify all missing spots within a limited time while avoiding incorrect selections. The game features multiple difficulty levels, a leaderboard system, and an admin panel for puzzle management.

## 🧠 Software Engineering Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Version Control
- Git used for tracking changes and feature development
- GitHub used for repository hosting and commit history
- Custom `.gitignore` file created to manage tracked files

### 2. Event-Driven Programming
- User interactions (clicks, timers, button events)
- Real-time UI updates based on player actions
- Countdown timers and dynamic game state changes

### 3. Interoperability
- Integration with the Banana API via HTTP requests
- JSON data exchange between systems
- Communication between frontend, backend, database, and external services

### 4. Virtual Identity
- User accounts and admin roles
- OTP-based admin authentication
- Session handling for identity persistence
- Identity-linked scores and leaderboard positions

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)

- Client (Web Browser)
- Backend Server (PHP)
- Database Server (MySQL)
- External Service (Banana API)

This represents a **distributed software architecture**.
